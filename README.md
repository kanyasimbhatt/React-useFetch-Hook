# UseFetch Hook

#### I have created this hook as part of react practical of the LMS. Here's the description of the task:

create a custom hook "useFetch" which takes URL, method (get/post/put/patch/delete), optional payload and an optional boolean flag for skipping the query call if consumer wants to skip the query based on certain conditions.
This custom hook should return the following things in form of object:

- isLoading
- response (actual data)
- error (if any)
  Here's the free API that can be used: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
  Create a React app to demonstrate the usage of this hook.
